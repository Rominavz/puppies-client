## Puppies-client
SPA (Single Page Application) with React and Redux for the Front End. All components were developed with pure CSS without the use of external libraries.
The SPA consumes data from an API (𝐑𝐚𝐰𝐠) through a BackEnd developed in Node.JS using Express, Sequelize and a PostgreSQL database, adding new functionalities to the original API.
Some features of the project: Search cache, ordering, filters, adding and removing a new puppy.
